		</div>
		
		<h2>Weekly Happenings</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>jQuery plugin <a href="http://www.steamdev.com/zclip/">zClip</a> that allows you to copy to clipboard (using Flash) was discovered!</li>
			<li>Anything else?</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>jQuery + Other Libraries</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>When working with another library that makes use of the <code>$</code> function, you can have jQuery run in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.noConflict/">No Conflict mode</a>, so it will reliquish control of the <code>$</code> function back to the other library:
				<pre><code class="javascript">jQuery.noConflict();
// Now, $() is no longer the jQuery function, but you can still access jQuery
// using the jQuery variable: jQuery("#selector")

// In the case where you have multiple jQuery versions on the same page, you
// can have the 2nd version of jQuery relinquish control of the jQuery
// variable to the 1st version and assign the 2nd version to a custom variable.
var jQueryTwo = jQuery.noConflict(true);</code></pre>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>My Development Environments</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>For text editors, I use:
				<ul>
					<li><a href="http://eclipse.org">Eclipse</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> (<a href="http://www.vim.org/">GVim</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/macvim/">MacVim</a>)</li>
					<li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a></li>
					<li><a href="http://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/xcode.html">XCode</a></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>I still develop in Firefox, but am moving to Chrome. Some of my co-workers still use IE8 as their primarly development Browser&mdash;this kills me.</li>
			<li>I test in IE7-IE9; Firefox 3.6 &amp; 4.0; Chrome Dev &amp; Chromium; Safari 5. Occasionally, I open up Lynx to see how pages render.</li>
			<li>At work, SVN is the only supported Version Control System, though I use git for my own small projects at both work and home. I admit that I still suck at git, but Git Immersion helps.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>More on My Development Environment</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>The languages I use most often are JavaScript (browser-based as well as server-side in node.js), Java, and Objective-C. For me, Vim is great for JavaScript and general Web Development, Notepad++ is great for presenting, Eclipse is great for <em>ginormous</em> projects (especially Java projects), and XCode is usable because of its integration with Interface Builder.</li>
			<li>Input-wise, I use the <a href="http://www.logitech.com/en-us/keyboards/keyboard-mice-combos/devices/7306">Logitech Wave Combo</a>. When I moved to McAfee, it was one of my requirements before I agreed to take the job. It's the first keyboard and mouse set I've ever truly enjoyed using.</li>
			<li>Monitor-wise, I appreciate two monitors. Since 2007, to do anything non-trivial, I've designed and developed on a box with dual screens.I'll do anything I can do to make sure the screens are the exact same model.</li>
			<li>OS-wise, I enjoy OS X more than Windows, though Windows 7 is delightful. I've yet to purchase a Mac Desktop, though I will always, <em>always</em> purchase Mac Laptops and only Mac Laptops.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>My Development Environment, Illustrated</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Here's <a href="assets/env_office.jpg">my current screen setup at work</a>.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>My Debugging Process</h2>
		<p>Problem: My code isn't running!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check for errors in Firefox's Error Console (Tools &raquo; Error Console)
				<ul>
					<li>Clear the console.</li>
					<li>Refresh the page with the broken JavaScript.</li>
					<li>Observe the code not working.</li>
					<li>Switch back to the Error Console and check for errors.</li>
					<li>If there's an error listed, find it, fix it, check if that fixed it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If there are no errors, I pop open Firebug's Script Panel.
				<ul>
					<li>Enable the Script Panel if it's not already enabled.</li>
					<li>Set a breakpoint on a line I would expect to execute.</li>
					<li>Refresh the page or cause the event that should trigger the code.</li>
					<li>If the breakpoint is triggered, I step through the code until it breaks, adding new breakpoints if necessary.</li>
					<li>If the breakpoint is not triggered, I add a new breakpoint earlier and earlier in the execution cycle, even back to the first line in the first &lt;script /&gt;.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Failing the first two (which is really, really rare), I check to ensure that JavaScript is enabled in my browser, restart the browser, and pray to the JavaScript gods.</li>
			<li>If all of those fail, I add an alert() to the very first line of my script and if it fires, I slowly move it down, line by line, until I find the broken line.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Extending jQuery</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Creating Plugins for JavaScript is as easy as adding a method to an Object.</li>
			<li>The simplest plugin is only a few lines and is available in <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Plugins/Authoring">jQuery's Plugin Documentation.</a></li>
			<li>Here is a jQuery plugin that locks a jQuery collection's dimensions:
				<pre><code class="javascript">(function($){
  $.fn.lockDimensions = function(type) {  
    this.each(function() {
      var $this = $(this);

      if (!type || type == 'width') {
        $this.width($this.width());
      }
      if (!type || type == 'height') {
        $this.height($this.height());
      }
    });
	
	return this;
  };
}(jQuery));</code></pre>
			</li>
			<li>Let's <a href="inclass/plugin.html">use it and dissect what it's doing.</a></li>
		</ul> 
		
		<h2>Mobile Development with jQuery</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Mobile Web Development is a bit of a hot topic.</li>
			<li>There are three front-runners: <a href="http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/">Sencha Touch</a>, <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> and <a href="http://www.winktoolkit.org/">Wink Toolkit</a>.</li>
			<li>jQuery Mobile is the most appropriate for us, as it's being built by many folks that build jQuery. I've <a href="examples/mybrary/index.html">created a demo for us to play with</a>.</li>
			<li>Sencha Touch is also important. Sencha Touch 1.0 is now free (released under the GPL) or availble for purchase (so it can be used for non-GPL projects). <a href="examples/sencha-touch/examples/kiva/index.html">Let's take a look at their demo</a> and see how it works.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Unit Testing with Jasmine</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Unit Testing involves evaluating the smallest pieces of a larger system to ensure they work correctly.</li>
			<li>Typically, the 'units' that are tested in JavaScript are methods of objects.</li>
			<li>Frameworks exist that allow you to automate tests, like <a href="http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>.</li>
			<li>Technically, Jasmine is a Behavior-driven development framework (BDD), but it works very similarly to other unit testing frameworks.</li>
			<li>With Jasmine, we can <a href="examples/jasmine">write our unit tests</a>!</li>
		</ul>
