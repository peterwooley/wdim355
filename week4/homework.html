		<h2>Flickr Gallery</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a JavaScript Web Application that allows a user to search for images on Flickr by tag name and display them in a gallery.</li>
			<li>The UI should allow a user to enter a tag (or multiple tags using a comma-separated list) into an input field.</li>
			<li>The App should function similarly:
				<ul>
					<li>The user types in a Flickr tag they're looking for.</li>
					<li>The images are presented to them in a gallery-format (How the gallery works is up to you!).</li>
					<li>At any time, a user should be able to change their tag list and get an updated gallery.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>	
        
        <h3>Considersations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The formatting of your code and overall user experience of your app will be factored into your grade.</li>
            <li>You will present your app to the class next, so be prepared to walk us through it and show us your favorite bit of code.</li>
        </ul>
