		<h4>Flickr Gallery; due Week 5.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a JavaScript Web Application that allows a user to search for imags on Flickr by tag name and display them in a gallery.</li>
			<li>The UI should allow a user to enter a tag (or multiple tags using a comma-separated list) into an input field.</li>
			<li>The App should function similarly:
				<ul>
					<li>The user types in a Flickr tag they're looking for.</li>
					<li>The images are presented to them in a gallery-format (How the gallery works is up to you!).</li>
					<li>At any time, a user should be able to change their tag list and get an updated gallery.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
