		<h2>Midterm Projects!</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Turn in your midterm to <kbd>S:\Data\wdim355\week5\homework</kbd> named like <code>lastnameFirstname_midterm.zip</code>.</li>
			<li>We'll have everyone present their project, like so:
				<ol>

					<li>Walk us through your favorite piece of code.</li>
					<li>Tell us of your deepest jQuery struggle and highest triumph.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>

		<h2>Example of jQuery's Deferred Object</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Michael Bleigh of Intridea <a href="http://intridea.com/2011/2/8/fun-with-jquery-deferred">wrote up a great example of how to use the jQuery Deferred Object</a>.</li>
			<li>Let's play with it in the <a href="inclass/deferred.html">inclass/deferred.html</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2>My Debugging Process</h2>
		<p>Problem: My code isn't running!</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Check for errors in Firefox's Error Console (Tools &raquo; Error Console)
				<ul>
					<li>Clear the console.</li>
					<li>Refresh the page with the broken JavaScript.</li>
					<li>Observe the code not working.</li>
					<li>Switch back to the Error Console and check for errors.</li>
					<li>If there's an error listed, find it, fix it, check if that fixed it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If there are no errors, I pop open Firebug's Script Panel.
				<ul>
					<li>Enable the Script Panel if it's not already enabled.</li>
					<li>Set a breakpoint on a line I would expect to execute.</li>
					<li>Refresh the page or cause the event that should trigger the code.</li>
					<li>If the breakpoint is triggered, I step through the code until it breaks, adding new breakpoints if necessary.</li>
					<li>If the breakpoint is not triggered, I add a new breakpoint earlier and earlier in the execution cycle, even back to the first line in the first &lt;script /&gt;.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Failing the first two (which is really, really rare), I check to ensure that JavaScript is enabled in my browser, restart the browser, and pray to the JavaScript gods.</li>
			<li>If all of those fail, I add an alert() to the very first line of my script and if it fires, I slowly move it down, line by line, until I find the broken line.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h2>Homework?</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Heck no! Go have some fun!</li>
		</ul>
