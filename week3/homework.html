		<h4>Twittr; due Week 4.</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a JavaScript Web Application that accepts a form submission of a textarea and appends the content to a reverse chronological sorted list of messages (Yeah, like Twitter).</li>
			<li>The UI should have, at least, a title, textarea and submit button, and reverse chronological list of previous messages.</li>
			<li>The App should function similarly:
				<ul>
					<li>The user types in their message, hits submit, and the message is added to the top of the messages list.</li>
					<li>When a message is submitted the form should be emptied.</li>
					<li>At any time, a user should be able to delete an old message.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Tip: Create a single object that binds events to the form submission utlizing jQuery, other frameworks, or vanilla DOM access.</li>
			<li>Tip: Utilize a Message object that is stored in the main App object, which allows for the deletion of the message from the UI.</li>
		</ul>
